# Trident-XSS
A Hacking tool made for cross site scripting. V 1.0.3

To build just put: go build source.go

# Trident
Trident is a hacking tool for XSS attacks with simple python scripts that make the request, use at your own risk!
<br />
How it works:
So after specifying your flags, data and script, Trident will run the python script to create the request then it will connect with `net.Dial()` with a timeout (Default 10 seconds) after creating the request it will send it to the target.
Right now, trident does NOT work as intended
